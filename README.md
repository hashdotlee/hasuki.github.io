   I am Le Viet Hoang(hasuki), 17 years old, living in Viet Nam. I am studying Physics, Computer Science and little bit the other things. I think to my self, study simplely is find the True life, not live in others mind. We inherit from seniors - scientist, philosopher, artist... they are great man who have contributed for the world for all life. But one of these is not yours, you need to find some way to understand those and continuing your life within them. I always aspire to do something, something make sense in my life, something is everlasting. 

   About my school, i am learning in a high school for gifted students. For 2 years in this school, i have realized many things that change my thinking about the life. Next year, i will go to College to continue my big dream, it make me interesting. I have found my way, even it is so fuzzy, but i believe in it, and accept to go together. 
So happy, you know

I write this blog to build my mind, and share knowledge for you. Some of them can be my opinion, so please find out and help me improve. 

Thank you for reading!
